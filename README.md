# Portfolio
The aim was to create a portfolio page for myself with accessibility in mind. The page should be responsive so it doesn't matter what screen or browser the viewer is using and it should also function good with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## The problem

I used Google and Stack Overflow to fins answer to my questions. I only used HTML and CSS so I didn't bump into any bigger problems. I did have some issued with the color of the icons but I choose to go with white now, but I might change that in the future. I hope my page is OK for using a screen reader, but it's hard to know when you're not used to using that tool.
